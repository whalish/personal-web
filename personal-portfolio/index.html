          <p>A computer was trained to count the number of citrus in a picture, the images being supplied by the University's Department of Agriculture. The first rough method was to segment the image into many different subimages and classify each subimage as having citrus or not having citrus using the cifar-10 model of CNN, implemented in Keras run over Tensorflow. This was replaced by a more accurate method, written in Caffe, of using fast R-CNN to identify all regions of CNN and returning the total number of regions, and doing so quickly by using the feature map given by the first convolution to identify regions of interest.</p>

          <p>The Deep Cloud project is a web app in development to apply all models created from research, including citrus counting. The website provides friendly UI such that users can train their own models or use pretrained models without knowledge of deep learning. The subsequent models are saved and stored on our internal server so that the user can access them later to run inference.
            As part of the deep learning subteam, I wrote python scripts to load data, build the model, and export the model architecture and weights in HDF5 and protobuff formats to our server. I also connected with the web team and worked on modifying callback functions in order to send ETA, loss, and validation loss values in JSON format during training.
